- `/api/v1/version` - HTTP 200 OK

### 3. Build Frontend Against Live API
```bash
cd frontend && VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000 make build
```
✅ **PASSED** - Frontend built successfully with live API
- Build time: 443ms
- All assets generated

## Makefile Consistency Verification

✅ **CONFIRMED** - All CI steps use Makefile targets exclusively:
- No direct `npm` commands in CI
- No direct `poetry run` commands in CI
- All commands delegated through Makefiles
- Consistent behavior between local and CI environments

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Makefile
- Fixed `install-ci` to use `--with dev` for proper dependency installation
- Removed duplicate `frontend-client` and `watch-client` targets
- Added missing comment for `export-openapi` target

### 2. Frontend Makefile (NEW)
- Created comprehensive Makefile with all CI targets
- Includes: `install-ci`, `lint`, `type-check`, `test-run`, `build`
- Consistent with backend Makefile structure

### 3. CI Workflow
- Updated to use Makefile targets exclusively
- Removed direct npm/poetry commands
- Simplified and more maintainable

### 4. Project Makefile (project.mk)
- Updated to delegate to component Makefiles consistently
- Added frontend Makefile references
- Improved help documentation

### 5. Documentation
- Created `MAKEFILE-GUIDE.md` with comprehensive documentation
- Updated `frontend/src/services/README.md` formatting

## Benefits Achieved

1. ✅ **Consistency**: Same commands work locally and in CI
2. ✅ **Maintainability**: Centralized build logic in Makefiles
3. ✅ **Discoverability**: `make help` at each level
4. ✅ **Reliability**: All tests passing with new system
5. ✅ **Developer Experience**: No context switching between npm/poetry/make

## Next Steps

Ready to commit and push changes to trigger GitHub Actions workflow.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: implement consistent Makefile-based build system"
git push
```

## Test Commands for Quick Verification

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
make install-ci && make test-cov && make lint-check

# Frontend
cd frontend
make install-ci && make lint && make type-check && make test-run && make build

# Integration
cd backend && make dev-ci
cd backend && make health-ci
cd frontend && VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000 make build
```

**Conclusion**: All GitHub Actions steps have been verified locally. The new Makefile-based build system is working correctly and ready for deployment.
