# Custom Agent Creation Techniques

Techniques for authoring high-quality VS Code Custom Agent files (`.agent.md`). This skill teaches **craft** — how to make good design choices during agent creation — not workflow (the creating agent owns that).

---

## <constraints>

### CRITICAL
- **File location**: `.github/agents/{name}.agent.md` (user-facing) or `{name}.sub.agent.md` (subagent)
- **No code fence wrappers** — written agent files start directly with `---` (raw text). Read-back tools may display fences around file content as rendering artifacts — ignore those.
- **Valid tool aliases**: `read`, `search`, `edit`, `execute`, `agent`, `web/fetch`, `web`, `todo`

### IMPORTANT
- Use XML-style sections for Claude optimization (see `<agent_prompt_structure>`)
- Apply constraint hierarchy: CRITICAL > IMPORTANT > GUIDELINES
- Reference templates from `.github/agents/{type}-template.md` for full structure

### GUIDELINES
- Keep agent files under 200 lines — extract to skills if larger
- Use generic archetypes in examples, not specific agent names

</constraints>

## <yaml_reference>

### Required Properties

Every agent file must have:

```yaml
---
name: agent-name              # Lowercase, kebab-case, matches filename
description: What this agent does. Use when {trigger scenarios}.
---
```

### Conditional Properties — Decision Table

Include each property ONLY when the condition applies:

| Property | Include When | Skip When | Format |
|----------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| `model` | Agent needs a specific model tier | Default model is acceptable | `Claude Sonnet 4.5 (copilot)` |
| `tools` | Agent needs a restricted tool set | Agent should have all tools | `['read', 'search', 'edit']` |
| `agents` | Agent delegates to subagents | No delegation needed | `['research', 'verify']` |
| `user-invokable` | Subagent — set to `false` | User-facing (default `true`) | `false` |
| `handoffs` | Agent participates in workflow chains | Standalone agent | See `<handoff_design>` |
| `argument-hint` | Agent benefits from input guidance | Purpose is obvious from name | `"describe the feature"` |
| `disable-model-invocation` | Agent should never auto-activate | Agent can be auto-routed | `true` |

### Tool Alias Reference

| Alias | Maps To | Use Case |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `read` | `read_file`, `list_dir`, notebook tools | File inspection |
| `search` | `grep_search`, `file_search`, `semantic_search` | Code discovery |
| `edit` | `replace_string_in_file`, `create_file`, `multi_replace_string_in_file` | Code modification |
| `execute` | `run_in_terminal`, `get_terminal_output`, `await_terminal`, `kill_terminal`, `create_and_run_task` | Command execution |
| `agent` | `runSubagent` | Task delegation |
| `web/fetch` | `fetch_webpage` | Web content retrieval |
| `playwright/*` | `browser_click`, `browser_snapshot`, `browser_navigate`, etc. | Browser automation (Playwright MCP) |
| `todo` | `manage_todo_list` | Progress tracking |
| `context7/*` | `query-docs`, `resolve-library-id` | Versioned external library documentation |
| `filesystem/*` | `fs_batch_operations`, `fs_search_files`, etc. | Workspace-confined filesystem ops |
| `skillsmp/*` | `skillsmp_search`, `skillsmp_install_skill`, etc. | Skills marketplace |
| `mcp-registry/*` | `list_servers_v0`, `get_server_version`, etc. | MCP server registry |

**⚠️ MCP toolset glob rule**: All MCP toolsets **MUST** use the `/*` glob suffix (e.g., `'context7/*'`, NOT `'context7'`). Bare toolset names without `/*` produce VS Code warnings and may not resolve correctly.

**Least-privilege principle**: Start with the minimum tool set. Add tools only when the agent genuinely needs them.

## <frontmatter_decision_tree>

Construct the YAML frontmatter systematically:

```
1. NAME & DESCRIPTION (always required)
   └── name: kebab-case matching filename
   └── description: purpose + "Use when" trigger keywords

2. DEPLOYMENT MODE
   ├── User-facing? → file: {name}.agent.md (user-invokable defaults true)
   └── Subagent?    → file: {name}.sub.agent.md
                    → user-invokable: false (mandatory)
                    → No handoffs (SA-6)
                    → No agents list (SA-7)

3. MODEL SELECTION
   ├── Mostly reads/searches?           → Haiku 4.5
   ├── Writes code or reviews?          → Sonnet 4.5
   ├── Orchestrates or plans?           → Opus 4.6
   └── Subagent?                        → Default one tier below parent (SA-2)
   Format: "Claude {Model} {Version} (copilot)"

4. TOOL SET (least privilege)
   ├── Read-only agent?                 → ['read', 'search']
   ├── + needs web fetch?               → add 'web/fetch'
   ├── + needs browser automation?      → add 'playwright/*'
   ├── + needs external lib docs?       → add 'context7/*'
   ├── + writes code?                   → add 'edit'
   ├── + runs commands?                 → add 'bash'
   ├── + delegates?                     → add 'agent'
   └── + tracks progress?              → add 'todo'
   ⚠️ MCP toolsets ALWAYS use '/*' suffix: 'context7/*', 'filesystem/*', never bare 'context7'

5. DELEGATION (optional)
   ├── Spawns subagents?                → agents: ['name1', 'name2']
   └── No delegation?                   → omit agents

6. WORKFLOW TRANSITIONS (user-facing only)
   ├── Part of a chain?                 → add handoffs (see <handoff_design>)
   └── Standalone?                      → omit handoffs
```

## <agent_prompt_structure>

### Why XML Sections Work

Claude processes `<section_name>` tags as **semantic boundaries**, like HTML structures a document. Benefits:

- **Instruction following**: Content within named sections receives higher-priority attention
- **Selective retrieval**: Sections create natural "attention anchors" — the model targets `<constraints>` for rules, `<methodology>` for approach
- **Debuggability**: When an agent misbehaves, you can pinpoint which section failed

### Recommended Layout

```markdown
# Role Title

You are a **[Role]** that [purpose].

---

## <constraints>

### CRITICAL
- **VERB-FIRST RULE** — explanation

### IMPORTANT
- **VERB-FIRST RULE** — explanation

### GUIDELINES
- **VERB-FIRST RULE** — explanation

## <methodology>

### Phase 1: {Name}
[Phased approach, not flat lists]

</methodology>

## <output_format>

[Expected output structure]

</output_format>
```

### Section Naming Conventions

| Section | Purpose | Required? |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| `<constraints>` | Behavioral rules with hierarchy | Yes |
| `<methodology>` | Phased approach to tasks | Yes |
| `<output_format>` | Expected deliverable structure | Recommended |
| `<project_rules>` | Project-specific conventions | When applicable |
| `<caller_protocol>` | How parents invoke (subagents only) | Subagents: mandatory (SA-4) |
| `<anti_patterns>` | Common mistakes to avoid | Recommended |

</agent_prompt_structure>

## <constraint_craft>

Writing effective constraints is the highest-leverage skill in agent design. Weak constraints are the #1 quality problem.

### The 4 Properties of a Good Constraint

| Property | Test | Bad | Good |
|----------|------|-----|------|
| **Verb-first** | Starts with action verb? | "Generated code should be typed" | "**NEVER** use `any` type" |
| **Testable** | Can you verify compliance? | "Be careful with edits" | "**ALWAYS** run tests after file changes" |
| **Scoped** | Clear boundary? | "Don't break things" | "**NEVER** edit files in `*_generated/` directories" |
| **Actionable** | Agent knows what to do? | "Follow best practices" | "**MUST** use `make` targets instead of raw `npm`/`poetry`" |

### Constraint Strength Test

Before finalizing, evaluate each constraint:

```
1. If the agent ignores this, what breaks?
   → Nothing?              → GUIDELINE at most, or delete
   → Quality degrades?     → IMPORTANT
   → Incorrect/harmful?    → CRITICAL

2. Could I write a test for this constraint?
   → Yes → Good constraint
   → No  → Too vague, rewrite

3. Does this constraint duplicate another?
   → Yes → Merge or delete
```

### Constraint Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Example | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Vague mandate** | "Be thorough" | Delete — adds no information |
| **Unbounded scope** | "Always check everything" | Scope it: "Always check type errors before committing" |
| **Contradictory pair** | "Never modify files" + "Fix all errors" | Resolve: "Never modify generated files; fix errors in source only" |
| **Aspirational fluff** | "Strive for excellence" | Delete — constraints must be binary pass/fail |
| **Disguised tool instruction** | "Use grep_search to find patterns" | Move to methodology — constraints define WHAT, methodology defines HOW |

</constraint_craft>

## <skill_integration>

### Examples & Quick Reference

See companion files for concrete good/bad examples:
- [Prompt examples](../../agents/templates/prompt-examples.md) — VS Code variables, boundary guidance, thin vs bloated prompts
- [Skill examples](../../agents/templates/skill-examples.md) — Portability patterns, scope guidance, directory structure

### How Agents Reference Skills

Skills integrate into agents through two mechanisms:

#### 1. Inline Reference (in constraints or methodology)

```markdown
### IMPORTANT
- Apply `design-review` skill when validating architectural decisions
- Apply `terminal-usage` skill before running terminal commands
```

The agent reads the skill's SKILL.md via `read_file` when the skill becomes relevant. The skill description (in `copilot-instructions.md` or `<skill>` tag) triggers the load.

#### 2. Skill Tag Registration (in copilot-instructions.md)

```markdown
<skill>
<name>debug-hypothesis</name>
<description>Hypothesis-driven debugging. Use when investigating root cause.</description>
<file>.github/skills/debug-hypothesis/SKILL.md</file>
</skill>
```

### Progressive Disclosure Levels

| Level | What Loads | Cost | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1: Description** | Name + 1-line description | ~20 tokens | Always (base instructions) |
| **L2: Full skill** | SKILL.md body | ~200-500 tokens | Description matches task |
| **L3: Resources** | Supplementary files | Variable | Skill explicitly references them |

### Inline vs Extract Decision

```
Skill content < 5 lines?          → Inline in agent (not worth a file)
Skill content 5-30 lines?         → Inline if agent-specific; extract if reusable
Skill content > 30 lines?         → Always extract to skill file
Used by 2+ agents?                → Always extract to skill file
```

### Writing Good Skill Descriptions

The description is the trigger mechanism — optimize for **recall** (catches relevant tasks) without over-broad **precision**:

```markdown
<!-- ❌ Low recall -->
<description>For testing</description>

<!-- ❌ Low precision -->
<description>For development work</description>

<!-- ✅ Balanced -->
<description>Test planning, coverage analysis, and test pattern selection.
Use when designing test strategies or analyzing test gaps.</description>
```

## <handoff_design>

### Handoff Mechanics

Handoffs create **lateral transitions** between peer agents. The user sees a button and chooses whether to transition.

```yaml
handoffs:
  - label: "Review Changes"        # Button text shown to user
    agent: review                   # Target agent
    prompt: "Review all changes made in this session."  # Context passed
    send: false                     # false = user confirms, true = auto-submit
```

### `send: true` vs `send: false`

| Setting | Behavior | Use When |
|---|---|---|
| `send: false` | User sees prompt, can edit before sending | **Default** — gives user control |
| `send: true` | Auto-submits to target agent immediately | Well-defined, low-risk transitions only |

### Common Workflow Chains

| Chain | Pattern | When |
|---|---|---|
| Analysis → Planning → Execution | study → plan → implement | New features, complex changes |
| Planning → Execution → Validation | plan → implement → review | Planned work with quality gate |
| Execution → Testing → Review | implement → test → review | Implementation-focused work |
| Diagnosis → Fix → Verify | implement (debug-hypothesis) → review | Bug fixing |

### Handoff Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Circular handoffs** | A → B → A creates infinite loops | Design directional chains |
| **Too many handoffs** | 5+ buttons overwhelm users | Max 2-3 handoffs per agent |
| **Vague prompt** | "Continue the work" gives no context | Specific: "Implement the plan from the analysis above" |
| **Subagent with handoffs** | Subagents don't interact with users (SA-6) | Remove — use parent's handoffs instead |

</handoff_design>

---

## <anti_patterns>

### Agent File Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Signal | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Monolith agent** | 300+ lines, does everything | Split: extract skills, add subagent delegation |
| **Tool hoarder** | Every tool alias included "just in case" | Audit: remove tools the agent never uses |
| **Flat methodology** | "1. Do this. 2. Do that." | Restructure into named phases with clear purpose |
| **Constraint soup** | 20 constraints, no hierarchy | Classify CRITICAL/IMPORTANT/GUIDELINES; delete fluff |
| **Template copy** | Agent is mostly template with placeholders filled | Customize: add domain knowledge, real constraints |
| **Skill-ignorant** | Reinvents methods that exist as skills | Search existing skills; reference them |

### Naming Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Example | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Verb-noun mismatch** | `code-writer.agent.md` | Use role noun: `implement.agent.md` |
| **Too generic** | `helper.agent.md` | Name the specialization: `review.agent.md` |
| **Missing `.sub` marker** | Subagent named `research.agent.md` | Rename: `research.sub.agent.md` |

</anti_patterns>
