# 📊 Documentation Assessment & Refactoring Plan Generation

You are a **technical documentation specialist**. Your sole purpose is to conduct a structural assessment of all project documentation and **generate a complete, self-contained plan** for a "follow-plan" agent to execute.

## 🎯 Objectives

1.  **Assess** all git-tracked documentation files for their current structure and topics.
2.  **Identify** potential areas for refactoring (merging, splitting, re-grouping).
3.  **Refactor** the documentation structure for optimal grouping and discoverability.
4.  **Create** a detailed assessment & refactoring plan (`documentation-assessment-plan.md`) that a separate agent can follow to perform the full update and verification.

## 📋 Scope

-   **Include**: All git-tracked `.md` files (root, `docs/`, `backend/`, `frontend/`, etc.)
-   **Exclude**:
    -   Files in `**/tmp/` directories (temporary/scratch files)
    -   Auto-generated docs in `frontend/src/clients_generated/`
    -   Files in `.github` related to copilot instructions and prompts
    -   Third-party documentation (verify references only, don't assess content)

## 🚨 Critical Rules (For the Plan)

The plan you generate must instruct the *next* agent to follow these principles:

-   **Accuracy First**: Documentation must precisely match actual code implementation.
-   **No Speculation**: Do not document future plans or assumptions.
-   **Cross-Reference**: Update all related docs when making changes.
-   **Relative Links**: All internal documentation references use relative links.
-   **Simple, Specific, Short**: Content must be easy to understand, unambiguous, and concise.
-   **Code Snippets**: Use illustrative snippets with source references, not raw code dumps.

## ⚙️ Workflow: Create Assessment & Refactoring Plan (Interactive)

This is an interactive, two-task process. **Do not proceed to the next task until I approve the current one.**

### Task 1.1: File & Guide Analysis (Structural Report)
1.  List all git-tracked `.md` files that fall within the defined **Scope**.
2.  Read `docs/DOCUMENTATION-GUIDE.md` and summarize the overall hierarchy.
3.  **delegate all documents scans using tool calls and summarization**, Process documents in manageable batches to prevent context overload. For each batch, use runSubagent to scan the files in parallel, collecting a list of covered topics and a length indicator (e.g., word count). Aggregate the results from all batches into a final list..
4.  Based on both the overall hierarchy and the collected topic and length data, perform the structural analysis.
5.  Propose specific documents to **merge** (to unify concepts), **split** (to improve focus), **re-group** (to enhance discoverability), or **summarize** (to reduce overload).
6.  This proposal is **Section 1: Documentation Refactoring Report**.
7.  **Present this Refactoring Report for my approval.**

---

### Task 1.2: Final Plan Generation (after approval of Task 1.1)
1.  Once I approve the Refactoring Report, you will generate the complete `docs/tmp/documentation-assessment-plan.md` file.
2.  This file must be a **complete, self-contained prompt** for a separate `follow-plan` agent. It must contain the following sections *inside* the markdown file:

    > #### Section 1: Documentation Refactoring Report
    > *(This section contains the **approved** refactoring plan from Task 1.1, detailing all merge/split/re-group actions.)*
    >
    > ---
    > #### Section 2: Assessment Wave Plan
    > *(This section lists **ALL files in their new, target (refactored) structure**. Each file must be an item in a sequential plan, grouped into "Waves".)*
    >
    > *(Example format for this section):*
    > **Wave 1: Module-Level Docs (The Specifics)**
    > -   [ ] **MERGE**: `backend/src/auth/README.md` and `backend/src/token/README.md` into new file `backend/docs/Authentication.md`.
    >     -   **Verification Source**: `backend/src/auth/service.py`, `backend/src/token/utils.py`
    > -   [ ] **UPDATE**: `frontend/src/components/Button/README.md`
    >     -   **Verification Source**: `frontend/src/components/Button/Button.tsx`
    >
    > **Wave 2: Sub-System Docs (The Summaries)**
    > -   [ ] ...

    >
    > *You are a technical documentation specialist. Follow this plan step-by-step. Update the checkboxes in this file as you complete each task.*
    >
    > 1.  **Perform all refactoring actions** (merge/split/re-group) as defined in Section 2.
    > 2.  For each document in order:
    >     -   **Understand**: Read the document and cross-reference it with its "Verification Source" (the actual code).
    >     -   **Verify**: Identify gaps, outdated info, and inconsistencies.
    >     -   **Apply**: Update the documentation file to be 100% accurate.
    >     -   **Validate**: Ensure all links, cross-references, and formatting are correct per the "Critical Rules".
    > 3.  After completing each task, **update its checkbox** in this file.
    > 4.  After completing each "Wave", provide a summary of progress.

    >
    > *After all waves in Section 2 are complete, perform these final steps:*
    >
    > 1.  **Compile findings** from the entire assessment.
    > 2.  **Create a final report** at `docs/tmp/documentation-assessment-report.md` containing:
    >     -   An executive summary with statistics (e.g., 45 files updated, 5 merged, 2 split).
    >     -   A summary of the structural changes applied from Section 1.
    >     -   Detailed findings by category (e.g., "Outdated Code Snippets", "Broken Links").
    >     -   Prioritized recommendations for future work.
    > 3.  **Regenerate** the `docs/DOCUMENTATION-GUIDE.md` to reflect the new file structure.

    > **Specific-to-Global Update Strategy:**
    > *Execute the plan in this order (as defined by the Waves in Section 2):*
    > -   **Phase 1: Module & Implementation Docs (The "Specific")**
    >     -   Document implementation details in module-level READMEs
    >     -   Target: `backend/src/module/README.md`, `frontend/src/component/README.md`
    > -   **Phase 2: Sub-System & Architecture Docs (The "Summary")**
    >     -   Summarize changes in area-specific documentation
    >     -   Target: `backend/README.md`, `backend/docs/*.md`, `frontend/README.md`, `frontend/docs/*.md`
    > -   **Phase 3: Root & Project-Wide Docs (The "Global")**
    >     -   Update cross-cutting documentation
    >     -   Target: `README.md`, `docs/*.md`
    > -   **Phase 4: Documentation Guide Regeneration**
    >     -   Reflect the new structure in `docs/DOCUMENTATION-GUIDE.md`
    >
    > ---
    > #### Section 6: Assessment Categorization
    >
    > *For each document, categorize as:*
    > -   **UP-TO-DATE** ✅: All references verified, no issues
    > -   **INCONSISTENT** ⚠️: Contains deprecated refs, terminology conflicts, broken links
    > -   **NEEDS-VERIFICATION** 🔍: Missing dates, complex cross-refs needing validation
    > -   **EXTERNAL** 📦: Third-party docs (verify references only)
    >
    > *For structural changes, categorize as:*
    > -   **RETAIN** 🔒: Document remains unchanged
    > -   **CONDENSE** 🔄: This document's content was merged into another.
    > -   **MERGE** 🔄: This document's content was merged into another.
    > -   **SPLIT** 🔄: This document was split into multiple new documents.

3.  After generating this complete plan, **present it for my final approval.**

## 🎯 Expected Deliverables (From *this* Agent)

1.  ✅ **Refactoring Report** (from Task 1.1)
2.  ✅ **Final Assessment & Refactoring Plan** (`docs/tmp/documentation-assessment-plan.md`) (from Task 1.2)

## 🔍 Assessment Categorization

*(This is reference information for you to use when building the plan)*
-   **UP-TO-DATE** ✅: All references verified, no issues
-   **INCONSISTENT** ⚠️: Contains deprecated refs, terminology conflicts, broken links
-   **NEEDS-VERIFICATION** 🔍: Missing dates, complex cross-refs needing validation
-   **EXTERNAL** 📦: Third-party docs (verify references only)

Then, for structural changes, categorize as:

-   **RETAIN** 🔒: Document remains unchanged
-   **CONDENSE** 🔄: This document's content was merged into another.
-   **MERGE** 🔄: This document's content was merged into another.
-   **SPLIT** 🔄: This document was split into multiple new documents.

## 🚀 Begin Assessment

**Your first task is to execute Task 1.1 only:**
1.  List all git-tracked `.md` files that fall within the defined **Scope**.
2.  Read `docs/DOCUMENTATION-GUIDE.md` and summarize the overall hierarchy.
3.  **delegate all documents scans using tool calls and summarization**, Process documents in manageable batches to prevent context overload. For each batch, use runSubagent to scan the files in parallel, collecting a list of covered topics and a length indicator (e.g., word count). Aggregate the results from all batches into a final list..
4.  Based on both the overall hierarchy and the collected topic and length data, perform the structural analysis.
5.  Propose specific documents to **merge** (to unify concepts), **split** (to improve focus), **re-group** (to enhance discoverability), or **summarize** (to reduce overload).
6.  This proposal is **Section 1: Documentation Refactoring Report**.
7.  **Present this Refactoring Report for my approval.**

**Do not proceed to Task 1.2 until I approve.**
