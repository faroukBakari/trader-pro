Here is a detailed tutorial on how to use TradingView's trading features, from placing orders to managing your account.

### **Part 1: Understanding Your "Account Manager" (The Trading Panel)**

The Trading Panel is your central dashboard for all trading activity. It's what you referred to as the "account manager." It has several key tabs:

- **Positions:** This tab shows all your **current open trades**. You can see the symbol, the direction (Long/Buy or Short/Sell), the quantity, the average entry price, and your real-time Profit or Loss (P/L).
- **Orders:** This tab shows all your **pending orders**â€”that is, orders that have _not_ been filled yet. This includes Limit orders and Stop orders. If you place an order to buy an asset at a lower price, it will sit here until the market reaches that price.
- **History:** This shows a complete log of all your _executed_ orders, closed trades, and transactions. It's your trade journal.
- **Account Summary:** This gives you a high-level overview of your account, including your balance, equity (balance + open P/L), and margin used.

### **Part 2: How to Pass (Place) Orders**

There are three primary ways to place a trade on TradingView.

#### **Method 1: The Order Panel (Most Detailed)**

This is the standard method that gives you the most control.

1.  **Open the Panel:** On the right-hand side of your chart, click the blue "Buy" or red "Sell" button. Alternatively, right-click the chart and select "Trade" -> "Create new order...".
2.  **Configure Your Order:** An order ticket will appear.
    - **Order Type:**
      - **Market:** Buys or sells _immediately_ at the best available market price.
      - **Limit:** Places an order to buy _below_ the current price or sell _above_ the current price. Your order only fills at your specified price or better.
      - **Stop:** Places an order to buy _above_ the current price or sell _below_ the current price. This is used to "stop" a loss or to enter a trade on a breakout.
    - **Quantity:** Set the number of shares, lots, or units you want to trade.
    - **Take Profit (TP):** Check this box to set a price at which your trade will automatically close in profit. This is a _Limit_ order.
    - **Stop Loss (SL):** Check this box to set a price at which your trade will automatically close at a loss. This is a _Stop_ order.

**Usage Example (Limit Order):**

- **Goal:** You want to buy 100 shares of Apple (AAPL) if it dips to $150. The current price is $152.
- **Action:**
  1.  Open the Order Panel.
  2.  Select the **"Limit"** tab.
  3.  Set the **Price** to `$150`.
  4.  Set the **Quantity** to `100`.
  5.  (Optional) Set a **Take Profit** at `$160` and a **Stop Loss** at `$145`.
  6.  Click the blue **"Buy 100 AAPL"** button.
- **Result:** Your order is now visible in the **"Orders"** tab of your Trading Panel, waiting to be filled. It will also appear as a line on your chart.

#### **Method 2: Chart Trading (Right-Click)**

This is the fastest and most visual way to place _pending_ (Limit/Stop) orders.

1.  **Hover Your Mouse:** Move your mouse cursor to the _exact price level_ on the chart where you want to place your order.
2.  **Right-Click:** A context menu will appear.
3.  **Select Trade:** Hover over "Trade." TradingView will intelligently suggest the correct order type.
    - If you right-click _below_ the current price, it will offer **"Buy Limit..."**.
    - If you right-click _above_ the current price, it will offer **"Sell Limit..."** or **"Buy Stop..."**.

**Usage Example (Stop Entry):**

- **Goal:** You think if Bitcoin (BTCUSD) breaks _above_ $60,000, it will rise quickly. The current price is $59,500.
- **Action:**
  1.  Move your mouse to the `$60,000` level on the chart.
  2.  **Right-click** and select "Trade" -> **"Buy Stop 1 at 60000.00"**. (You can adjust the quantity later).
- **Result:** A pending Buy Stop order is instantly placed and appears in your "Orders" tab.

#### **Method 3: Quick Buy/Sell Buttons**

For scalpers and fast traders, you can enable buttons that place _market_ orders with one click.

1.  **Go to Settings:** Right-click the chart -> "Settings..." -> "Trading".
2.  **Enable Buttons:** Check the box for **"Buy/Sell buttons"**.
3.  **Click to Trade:** You will now see Buy and Sell buttons in the top-left corner of your chart. Clicking them will execute a market order for the default quantity you've set.

---

### **Part 4: How to Cancel Pending Orders**

If your Limit or Stop order has _not_ been filled yet, you can cancel it in two ways.

1.  **From the Chart:** Your pending order appears as a tag on the chart. Simply click the **'X'** on that tag. The order will be canceled immediately.
2.  **From the Trading Panel:** Go to the **"Orders"** tab. Find the order you want to cancel and click the **'X'** on the far right of its row.

### **Part 5: How to Close or Modify Open Positions**

Once your order is filled, it moves from the "Orders" tab to the **"Positions"** tab. Here is how you manage a live trade.

#### **Closing a Position (Full or Partial)**

- **Method 1: From the Chart (Fastest Close):**
  - Your open position is shown on the chart with its P/L. On the label, there is an **'X'**.
  - Clicking this **'X'** will send a _market order_ to close your _entire_ position immediately.

- **Method 2: From the Trading Panel (Most Control):**
  - Go to the **"Positions"** tab.
  - On the row of the position you want to close, click the **'X'**.
  - **Partial Close:** A confirmation window will pop up. By default, it will show the full quantity of your position. You can _edit_ this quantity.

**Usage Example (Partial Close):**

- **Goal:** You are long 0.50 lots of EUR/USD and are in profit. You want to lock in some profit but let the rest of the trade run.
- **Action:**
  1.  Go to the **"Positions"** tab.
  2.  Click the **'X'** on your EUR/USD position row.
  3.  A dialog box appears, showing "CLOSE POSITION" with a quantity of `0.50`.
  4.  Change the quantity from `0.50` to `0.25`.
  5.  Click the "CLOSE" button.
- **Result:** TradingView closes half your position (0.25 lots) at the market price, booking that profit. Your "Positions" tab will update to show you are still long 0.25 lots.

#### **Modifying Stop Loss (SL) and Take Profit (TP)**

The most intuitive feature of TradingView is modifying your SL and TP by _dragging them on the chart_.

- **If you set a SL/TP when you opened the trade:** You will see them as lines on your chart (often labeled "SL" and "TP").
- **To Modify:** Simply **click and drag** the "SL" line to a new price level to adjust your stop. The same goes for the "TP" line. It's that simple.
- **To Add SL/TP to an _existing_ trade:**
  1.  Go to the **"Positions"** tab.
  2.  Find your open position. In the "Take Profit" or "Stop Loss" column, click "Add".
  3.  You can then enter a price, or even easier, click-and-drag the resulting lines on the chart.
